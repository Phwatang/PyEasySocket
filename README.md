# PyEasySocket
Manage the creation, running and deletion of asynchronous websockets in a synchronous enviroment

This came about as a learning exercise for asyncio and websockets. Main goal was to be able to open many websockets in parallel (on a single background thread) without having to interact directly with any asynchronous keywords/code.
